`maped` is a tile map editor specifically targetting the Amstrad CPC Plus. It has built-in support for the standard CPC screen modes and enforces restrictions that make sense given the platform. It is designed to be used in conjunction with an image editor and is most useful for editing existing image maps and assigning and keeping track of map metadata.

`maped` depends on Python 3, pytk (distributed with Python by default on Windows and Mac) and pypng. pypng can be installed using pip, by running `pip install pypng` or equivalent from a terminal. Linux users may want/need to use their distribution's package manager to install dependencies.
